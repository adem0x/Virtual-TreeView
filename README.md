# Virtual-TreeView
Virtual Treeview (VT) is a Delphi treeview control built from ground up. Many years of development made it one of the most flexible and advanced tree controls available today. Virtual Treeview starts off with the claim to improve many aspects of existing solutions and introduces some new technologies and principles which were not available before.

###About This Fork
I plan to keep VT compatible with XE2.
